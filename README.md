HtmlMinify.py
=============
I needed a quick little python script for minimizing html that I could easily integrate into the build script of a project I was working on. Since the only usable thing I could find at the time was [kangax's js script](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier/ "kangax / html-minifier"), I went to work converting his over to python. 

I had to make a few changes to some of the existing regular expressions, due to some funky effects when dealing with unclean html, but it shouldn't affect the end size too much. Let me know if you notice anything off.

All credit goes to him, since the entire script's logic down to the regular expressions are clones of his work.
